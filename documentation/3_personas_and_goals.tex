\chapter{Personas and Goals}\label{C:personas}

\section{Primary persona}

Content creator, open source project maintainer, teacher.

Their motivation is to present a technical problem and the solution clearly and in an easy-to-understand way. The best option showing a demo, what happens if we insert the suggested code, how easy to use it. Most of the times a presentation involves more steps. For example we would like to show a starting state, maybe a few lines of code which we are able to simplify, so in this case the first step is showing the problem and after we show step by step how we solve that.

\section{Secondary persona}

The consumer, who watch the presentation, who reads the tutorial and who wants to learn more about the actual problem.

They would like to play, stop, control the presentation. Control the flow, going forward or stepping back.

They would like to try out the solution, for example how the final state changes if they modify the code.
