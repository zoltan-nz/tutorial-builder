\begin{abstract}

This project is about building an online publishing tool prototype, using code editors and step by step instructions to present programming challenges or solution for a computer science problem.

The prototype has two parts, an administration area, where the content creator can build a tutorial, and a player tool, where the recorded steps would be presented. This player should be embeddable in any blog post or website.

The primary target user is the creator, who composes a new tutorial. The creator can be a teacher, or an open source project owner, who would like to introduce his tool or code.

The secondary user is the consumer, who wants to learn or know more about a problem or a coding solution.
