\begin{abstract}

My project is about building an online publishing tool prototype, using code editors and step by step instructions to present programming challenges or solution for a computer science problem.

The prototype has two parts, an administration area, where the content creator can build a tutorial, and a player tool, where the recorded steps would be presented. This player should be embeddable in any blog post or website.
