\chapter{The problem and the solution}\label{C:problem}

When a developer, teacher or hobbyist would like to present a computer programming problem or solution, most of the times they record a video and publish it on YouTube. Sometimes the easiest way to record a video of a conference/meetup presentation or a live coding session. However recording and editing a high-quality video is time-consuming and less flexible. It is hard to update.

Other problem with showing tutorials with a simple video, that the audience cannot try it out, they have to configure their computer and environment to play with the presented solution.

Most of the cases we would like to show instructions and code snippets, mainly text-based contents. It is preferred to show code snippets in a more realistic environment, in a code editor. So using the online code editor, with a pre-scripted way to play our presentation, where the user can step back and forward and can modify or play with the code is more interactive, involving and helps to understand a problem more clearly.

Additionally, it is much easier to maintain, upgrade or fix for the content creator.

Furthermore, the user can try out and can see the result also, so immediately can practice the new information.

\section{The technology of choice}

One of the most popular programming languages in web development is JavaScript. The usage of this frontend focused technology is growing quickly.  It is the 7th on Tiobe Index, which is a good indicator of programming languages popularity. \cite{tiobe}

Learning and teaching JavaScript, HTML and CSS is important. My tool focuses on this three main building blocks of the web.

Building a frontend heavy application, with a dynamic, user-friendly interface is more common nowadays. In the last few years JavaScript based frontend frameworks became a matured, production ready tools. Server side technologies, like database management and time and resource heavy processes are separated from the user focused, design driven view layer, which is developed with usage of frontend frameworks.

The most popular tools are Angular.js, React.js and Ember.js. In my project I use Ember.js. It is an "opinionated" framework. Opinionet, convention over configuration driven framework means, that developers should follow specific conventions, instead of freely using the tool. A more strict environment helps to adapt the best practices and speed up the development process also.

Certainly, we still have to store data and information, so we cannot live without backend and server technology. Luckily there are already cloud-based tools for managing databases. I use Firebase, which is a service provided by Google. Firebase is a cloud-based database, document-store solution and easy to integrate with Ember.js.

Additionally, I build a traditional backend server application also to support development and experimenting with a real server side and a cloud-based solutions parallel. My preferred technology on backend side is Ruby on Rails, a popular, also opinionated and convention over configuration driven backend framework.
